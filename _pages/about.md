<p style="text-align: justify;font-family: Roboto;">
I am Gongchao Chen (陈巩超), currently pursuing a Master’s degree at Henan Institute of Science and Technology. In Jul. 2024 - Jul. 2025, I worked as a visiting student at Advanced Ocean Institute of Southeast University, Nantong. My research interests are Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Image Processing.
</p>

<i style="font-family: Roboto;">
I am currently seeking opportunities to pursue a Ph.D. degree. <br>
I am deeply interested in computer vision research and look forward to opportunities for collaboration where I can contribute and continue to grow. [<a href="./images/Curriculum Vitae.pdf" target="_blank">Curriculum Vitae</a>] [<a href="./images/WeChat.png" target="_blank">WeChat</a>]
